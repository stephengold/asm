# asm
This is an adaptation of ASM 3.1, a very small and fast Java bytecode manipulation framework from October 2007.

The source code was extracted from https://github.com/stephengold/jbullet/blob/a86ef8b465c2c523607a520f60fd563c14a6aa89/lib/ASM3.1/src.zip,
and Gradle build scripts were added.

I'm using this very old version to ensure compatibility with Martin Dvorak's stack-alloc project.
